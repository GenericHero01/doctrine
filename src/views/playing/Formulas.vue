      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>A number of formulas depend on a variable called L, for 'Level Factor', which increases with levels. It is calculated as:</p>

        <p>
          <code>L = 5.5 * 1.1 ^ level</code>
        </p>

        <p>The formula is adjusted to taper off above level 15 in order to reduce stratification and ensure that players can take part in higher-level content without necessarily being at the level cap.</p>

        <p>Here are the values of L above 15:</p>

        <p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Player Damage</div>

        <div class="subtitle-2">Physical Damage</div>

        <p>
          <code>damage = weapon damage + attack power / 16</code>
        </p>

        <p>In other words, increasing your attack power by 16 will do 1 more damage every physical attack.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-2">Magical Damage</div>

        <p>
          <code>magical damage = spell power / 10</code>
        </p>

        <p>In other words, increasing your spell power by 10 will deal or heal 1 damage.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note</strong>: wielding a two-handed weapon increases attack power and spell power by 50%.
        </p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Weapon Damage</div>

        <p>Damage for 1-handed weapons:</p>

        <p>
          <code>1H damage = L / 2</code>
        </p>

        <p>Damage for 2-handed weapons:</p>

        <p>
          <code>2H damage = 1.5 * L / 2</code>
        </p>

        <p>Enchanted weapons get another 1.2x bonus damage per attack.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Armor</div>

        <p>Non-weapon equipped items can give armor to the wearer when worn. How much armor depends on the L value as well as another called S, for 'Slot Constant', which is 1.25x for head, body &amp; legs items and 1x for shield, arms hands, waist and feet.</p>

        <p>
          <code>armor = L * S</code>
        </p>

        <p>Enchanted items give an extra 1.2x armor.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Shields</div>

        <p>Shields reduce all damage taken (resilience) by 25%. In addition, they provide more armor than regular equipment, their armor value being:</p>

        <p>
          <code>Regular shield armor = L * 1.25 * 8</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>Heavy shields armor = L * 1.25 * 12</code>
        </p>
