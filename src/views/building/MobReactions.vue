        <p>Reactions are ways for mobs to react to events around them, by issuing commands.</p>

        <p>Reactions must be commands, and you can have one command on each line.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Room is entered</div>
        <p>React to a character entering the mob’s room. If an integer is defined in the option field, the reaction gating delay will be set to that. Otherwise, it will default to 10.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Something is said</div>
        <p>React to a character saying something. If any of the said tokens match any of the tokens in the option field, the reactions will be run.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Time has elapsed</div>
        <p>Say a random command among the reaction commands at the interval defined by the option field. Defaults to 60 seconds.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Mob loads</div>
        <p>The first commands to be executed by a mob loading in the world.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Player connects</div>
        <p>React to a character entering the game in the mob's room.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Item is received</div>
        <p>React to a character giving an item to a mob. The option field should be the ID of the item’s template.</p>
